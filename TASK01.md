# PRODIGY_DS_01

# Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

This is a brief summary of the project.

# Task Summary

This task involves creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## Description

The goal of this task is to create a visual representation of the distribution of a variable using a bar chart or histogram. This will help us to understand the frequency or proportion of each category or value in the dataset.

## Steps

1. Load the dataset Orders ( you can choose any dataset) using the `read.csv` function.
2. Filter the dataset to include only the variable of interest and its corresponding value.
3. Rename the columns to make them more readable.
4. Load the `ggplot2` package.
5. Create a bar chart or histogram using the `ggplot` function and the appropriate geom function (`geom_bar` for categorical variables or `geom_histogram` for continuous variables).
6. Customize the plot as needed (e.g., add labels, change colors, etc).

## Tools used :
R-Stdio
packages: ggplot2 , readR.

## Source code of the project

Here's an example of how to create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of regions in a sample dataset:

```R
library(readxl)
Orders <- read_excel("C:/Users/shrav/Downloads/Orders.xlsx")
print(Orders)

library(ggplot2)

state <- Orders$State
order_id <- Orders$`Order ID`
order_date <- Orders$`Order Date`
customer_name <- Orders$CustomerName
customer_id <- Orders$customer_id
city <- Orders$City
order_total <- Orders$order_total
product_cost <- Orders$`Product cost`
category <- Orders$Category


# Create a bar chart
ggplot(Orders, aes(x = category )) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of category",
       x = "category")

# Features

* Allows users to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram.
* Supports loading data from the desired dataset using the `read.csv` function.
* Allows users to filter the dataset to include only the variable of interest and its corresponding value.
* Supports renaming columns to make them more readable.
* Uses the `ggplot2` package to create the bar chart or histogram.
* Allows users to customize the plot as needed (e.g., add labels, change colors, etc.).
* Provides an example of how to create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of regions in a sample dataset.
